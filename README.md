Future TODOs:
- Better styling for the pages, especially for the Movie Card(the window with the specific movie details).
- change the Favorites storage to not be a localStorage. Because it has the potential to become huge. 
- more detailed information about the movie, also include YouTube Videos
- resolutions
- Add Loader (to visualise the loader while we are getting the information)
- default image for movies that dont have a poster
- on empty search return all movies
- Optimizing the code
- gzip, uglifyjs
